The study "Neurofibroma Detection and Classification" aims to develop a robust system for detecting and classifying neurofibroma in MRI reports using convolutional neural networks (CNNs).
Neurofibroma, a benign nerve sheath tumor, requires timely care to prevent severe complications. The research utilizes a brain tumor 
database with 3,064 T1-weighted contrast-enhanced MRI images from Nanfang Hospital, covering glioma, meningioma, and pituitary tumors in sagittal, axial, and coronal planes.
Additionally, it includes a Kaggle dataset with 5,712 training and 1,311 test MRI images categorized into four classes: No tumor, Glioma, Pituitary, and Meningioma.
It is developed in Python with TensorFlow and Keras, the system leverages CNNs for image recognition and OpenCV for preprocessing.
The workflow comprises data collection, preprocessing, model building, training, validation, and testing. This study contributes to automated healthcare by improving neurofibroma diagnosis.

This study not only aims to enhance the diagnostic capabilities for neurofibroma detection but also seeks to improve the overall workflow for radiologists by automating the process. 
By integrating machine learning into healthcare, the system significantly reduces the reliance on manual diagnosis, minimizes human error, and expedites the identification of critical cases.
Furthermore, this research contributes to the broader field of automated healthcare solutions, paving the way for future innovations in medical diagnostics and treatment planning.
In conclusion, the study highlights the transformative potential of CNN-based models in medical imaging, particularly in the detection and classification of neurofibroma. 
The proposed system bridges a critical gap in medical diagnostics by providing a reliable, effective, and scalable solution, ultimately contributing to better patient care and outcomes.
